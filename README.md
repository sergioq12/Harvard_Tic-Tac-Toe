# Harvard Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is my solution for 
### Harvard CS50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Tic Tac Toe Project

The project details can be found in: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/0/tictactoe/

## Project Details

The main purpose of the project is to create an AI agent capable of performing intelligent moves in the game Tic Tac Toe.
The way it works is with the MiniMax Algorithm that tries to use both players confronting each other. Each player is trying to win.
Therefore, the algorithm tries to look ahead within the best of each player's movement to win, and then, the AI will know the best
possible outcome to decide on an action.
